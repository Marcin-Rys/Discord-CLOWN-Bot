# Discord-CLOWN-Bot
Small discord bot to do fun things!

Hello!
This bot has been made using Google Gemini AI. I was using it to learn how Python works, so there might be some errors. I want to notice again - this is made mostly by AI, I was just asking questions.

To start this bot you'll need to:
1. Edit .env.example file with variables: (of course in this and next step, then remove .example from file name)
DISCORD_TOKEN=''  # - add here your bot token
DISCORD_GUILD=''  # - add here your guild name

2. Create and populate data files(jokes.json, responses.json, statuses.json, swears.json)

3. And then just run main.py!
